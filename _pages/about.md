I'm Badhan Chandra Das, PhD candidate at Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences (KFSCIS), Florida International University. My research is primarily focused on the privacy and security of AI, federated learning, computer vision, large language models, and their real-world applications. I am also a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) at Sustainability, Optimization, and Learning for InterDependent Networks Laboratory (solid lab), FIU. Before joining FIU, I served as a lecturer in Computer Science department at Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT), Bangladesh. I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh, and completed MS in the esame discipline from the same department. Apart from my academics and profession, I love reading books, traveling, and exploring new things.
